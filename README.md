# Query_Supplier

This is a console application that contains arrays for suppliers, parts, and shipments. The console will prompt the user to input a color from the parts list and query a list of distinct cities that coincides with the color. The console will then query the supplier names in ascending order. Finally, the console will ask for a shipment number from the shipments list and query the part name as well as the quantity of that part from the shipment list.
